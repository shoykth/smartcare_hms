## 🔧 **ISSUES FOUND & FIXED**

### **Issue 1: Firestore Security Rules Not Published** 🚨 CRITICAL
**Status:** ⚠️ **USER ACTION REQUIRED**

**Problem:**
- Rules file is correct on local computer
- BUT rules are NOT published to Firebase Console
- App getting "permission-denied" errors

**Evidence:**
```
Error: [cloud_firestore/permission-denied] The caller does not have permission
```

**Solution:**
```
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select: hospital-management-app-11e7f
3. Click: Firestore Database → Rules
4. Copy from: FIRESTORE_RULES_READY_TO_PASTE.txt
5. Paste and Publish
```

**Impact:** 🔴 HIGH - Blocks all patient booking functionality

---

### **Issue 2: Compound Query Requiring Index** ✅ FIXED
**Status:** ✅ Fixed in Code

**Location:** `lib/services/doctor_availability_service.dart` - Line 196-198

**Problem:**
```dart
// ❌ OLD: Compound query needing index
final snapshot = await _availabilityCollection
    .where('doctorId', isEqualTo: doctorId)
    .where('isActive', isEqualTo: true)  // Second where = index needed
    .get();
```

**Solution:**
```dart
// ✅ FIXED: Single where + client-side filter
final snapshot = await _availabilityCollection
    .where('doctorId', isEqualTo: doctorId)
    .get();

final availabilityRules = snapshot.docs
    .map((doc) => DoctorAvailabilityModel.fromMap(...))
    .where((rule) => rule.isActive)  // Filter on client
    .toList();
```

**Impact:** 🟡 MEDIUM - Would cause "requires an index" error

---

### **Issue 3: OrderBy Queries Needing Indexes** ✅ FIXED
**Status:** ✅ Already Fixed (Previous Session)

**Locations:**
- `doctor_availability_service.dart` - `getAvailabilityForDoctor()`
- `appointment_service.dart` - `getAppointmentsByDoctor()`
- `appointment_service.dart` - `getAppointmentsByPatient()`
- `appointment_service.dart` - `getTodayAppointmentsByDoctor()`
- `appointment_service.dart` - `getPendingAppointmentsByDoctor()`

**Solution:**
All queries now use client-side sorting instead of Firestore `.orderBy()`
