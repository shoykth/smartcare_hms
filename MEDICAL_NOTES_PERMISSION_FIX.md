# ðŸ”§ Medical Notes Permission Fix

## ðŸš¨ Issue
Doctors getting permission denied error when trying to view medical notes:
```
Error: [cloud_firestore/permission-denied] The caller does not have permission to execute the specified operation.
```

## âœ… Solution
Updated Firestore security rules to allow **all doctors** to read medical notes, not just the doctor who created them.

### Changed Rule:
**Before:**
```javascript
allow read: if request.auth != null && 
  (resource.data.patientId == request.auth.uid || 
   resource.data.doctorId == request.auth.uid ||
   isAdmin());
```

**After:**
```javascript
allow read: if request.auth != null && 
  (resource.data.patientId == request.auth.uid || 
   isDoctor() ||
   isAdmin());
```

## ðŸ”¥ How to Apply the Fix

1. Go to **Firebase Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Select your project: **Hospital Management App**
3. Navigate to **Firestore Database**
4. Click on **Rules** tab
5. Find the `medical_notes` collection rules
6. Update the read permission as shown above
7. Click **"Publish"**

## ðŸ“‹ Complete Updated Rules

Copy the complete rules from: `FIRESTORE_SECURITY_RULES.md`

## âœ… After Publishing

Test by:
1. Login as Doctor
2. Go to "Medical Notes" 
3. Select any patient
4. Should now be able to view all medical notes

**Status:** âœ… Fixed - Doctors can now view all medical notes
