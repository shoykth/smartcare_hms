# üóìÔ∏è PHASE 4 PROGRESS - Appointment Scheduling System

## ‚úÖ Completed So Far

### 1. **Enhanced AppointmentModel** ‚úÖ
**File:** `lib/models/appointment_model.dart`

**Updates:**
- ‚úÖ Changed from single `date` + `timeSlot` string to `startTime` + `endTime` UTC timestamps
- ‚úÖ Added `createdBy` field (UID of requester)
- ‚úÖ Added `cancelledBy` and `cancellationReason` fields
- ‚úÖ Added helper methods:
  - `durationMinutes` - Calculate appointment duration
  - `isPast` - Check if appointment is in the past
  - `isUpcoming` - Check if appointment is upcoming
  - `timeSlot` - Get formatted time slot string (backward compatible)
  - `overlapsWith(DateTime start, DateTime end)` - Check for time conflicts
  - `parseDateTime(DateTime date, String time)` - Parse time strings to UTC timestamps

**New Fields:**
```dart
final Timestamp startTime;     // UTC timestamp
final Timestamp endTime;       // UTC timestamp  
final String createdBy;        // Patient UID
final String? cancelledBy;     // Who cancelled
final String? cancellationReason;
```

### 2. **Doctor Availability Model** ‚úÖ
**File:** `lib/models/doctor_availability_model.dart`

- Weekly recurring availability (Monday-Sunday)
- Time ranges per day (e.g., "09:00" to "17:00")
- Configurable slot duration (20, 30, 60 minutes)
- Exception dates (days off, holidays)
- Active/inactive toggle
- Methods to generate time slots and check availability

**Data Structure:**
```dart
{
  doctorId: string,

  startTime: "09:00",       // 24-hour format
  endTime: "17:00",
  slotDurationMinutes: 30,
  exceptions: [
    {
      date: DateTime,
      isOff: bool,

## üöß Remaining Tasks

### 4. **Enhance AppointmentService** (In Progress)
**File:** `lib/services/appointment_service.dart`

**Need to Add:**
- [ ] Conflict checking before creating appointment
- [ ] Use Firestore transactions for atomic operations
- [ ] Range queries for overlapping appointments
- [ ] Cancel appointment with reason
- [ ] Reschedule appointment
- [ ] Better error messages for conflicts

**Conflict Check Logic:**
```dart
// Query: Find appointments where:
// startTime < newEndTime AND endTime > newStartTime
final conflicts = await _firestore
  .collection('appointments')
  .where('doctorId', isEqualTo: doctorId)
  .where('startTime', isLessThan: newEndTime)
  .where('endTime', isGreaterThan: newStartTime)
  .where('status', whereIn: ['pending', 'confirmed'])
  .get();

if (conflicts.docs.isNotEmpty) {
  throw Exception('Time slot conflict');
}
```

      .collection('appointments')
      .where('doctorId', isEqualTo: appointment.doctorId)
      .where('startTime', isLessThan: appointment.endTime)
      .get();
    
    final conflicts = conflictQuery.docs.where((doc) {
      final existing = AppointmentModel.fromMap(doc.data(), doc.id);
      return existing.endTime.toDate().isAfter(appointment.startTime.toDate()) &&
             existing.status != AppointmentStatus.cancelled;
    });
    
    if (conflicts.isNotEmpty) {
      throw Exception('Time slot no longer available');
    }
    
    // 2. Create appointment

    // Refresh available slots
    refreshSlots();
  } else {
    showError('Failed to book appointment');
  }
}
```

---

### 12. **Firestore Security Rules** (Pending)
**File:** `FIRESTORE_SECURITY_RULES.md` (update)

**Rules to Add:**
```javascript
// Appointments collection
match /appointments/{appointmentId} {
  // Patients can create appointments for themselves
  allow create: if request.auth != null &&
                request.resource.data.patientId == request.auth.uid &&
                request.resource.data.createdBy == request.auth.uid &&
                request.resource.data.status == 'pending';
  
  // Read: Patient, Doctor, or Admin
  allow read: if request.auth != null &&
              (resource.data.patientId == request.auth.uid ||
               resource.data.doctorId == request.auth.uid ||
               isAdmin());
  
  // Update: Patient (cancel only), Doctor (status updates), Admin (all)
  allow update: if request.auth != null &&
                (
                  // Patient can cancel their own appointment
                  (resource.data.patientId == request.auth.uid &&
                   request.resource.data.status == 'cancelled') ||
                  
                  // Doctor can update status and notes
                  (resource.data.doctorId == request.auth.uid &&
                   request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys()
                     .hasOnly(['status', 'notes', 'updatedAt'])) ||
                  
                  // Admin can do anything
                  isAdmin()
                );
  
  // Delete: Only admin
  allow delete: if request.auth != null && isAdmin();
}

// Doctor availability collection
match /doctor_availability/{availabilityId} {
  // Anyone can read availability
  allow read: if request.auth != null;
  
  // Only the doctor or admin can write
  allow write: if request.auth != null &&
               (resource.data.doctorId == request.auth.uid || isAdmin());
}
```

---

### 13. **Testing Checklist** (Pending)
**File:** Create `test/appointment_test.dart`

**Unit Tests:**
- [ ] `overlapsWith()` method with various scenarios
- [ ] `isDoctorAvailableAt()` with conflicts
- [ ] `generateAvailableSlots()` with exceptions
- [ ] Time slot parsing
- [ ] Conflict detection logic

**Integration Tests:**
- [ ] Create appointment successfully
- [ ] Create conflicting appointment (should fail)
- [ ] Cancel appointment
- [ ] Reschedule appointment
- [ ] Doctor confirms appointment
- [ ] Generate slots for week

**Manual Test Cases:**
1. **Concurrent Booking:**
   - Two patients book same slot simultaneously
   - One should succeed, one should get error
   
2. **Timezone Handling:**
   - Book appointment from different timezone
   - Verify stored as UTC
   - Verify displays in local time
   
3. **Availability Exceptions:**
   - Set doctor as unavailable on a date
   - Verify no slots generated for that date
   
4. **Past Slot Prevention:**
   - Try to book appointment in the past
   - Should be blocked

### Long Term (Phase 4C):
8. **Notifications system** (local + push)
9. **Calendar integration**
10. **Comprehensive testing**

---

## üîß Quick Setup Instructions

### 1. Update Existing Files

The AppointmentModel has breaking changes. You need to update:
- `doctor_appointments_screen.dart` - Update to use `startTime`/`endTime`
- Any code that creates appointments

### 2. Add to pubspec.yaml (Later)

```yaml
dependencies:
  # For calendar integration
  add_2_calendar: ^3.0.1
  device_calendar: ^4.3.2
  
  # For notifications
  flutter_local_notifications: ^17.0.0
  firebase_messaging: ^14.7.10
```

### 3. Update Firebase Security Rules

Copy the new rules from the "Security Rules" section above to Firebase Console.

---

## üìù Notes

- All timestamps are stored as UTC in Firestore
- Time conversions happen in the UI layer
- Conflict detection uses range queries on startTime/endTime
- Transactions prevent race conditions during booking
- Availability exceptions override regular schedules

---

**Status:** Phase 4 is ~30% complete. Core data models and services are ready. UI screens and integrations pending.

**Estimated Completion:** 15-20 more screens and services to build.

**Recommendation:** Focus on Patient Booking Flow first (highest user value), then doctor availability management, then nice-to-have features like calendar export and advanced notifications.
