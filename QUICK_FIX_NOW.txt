🚨 URGENT FIX - DO THIS NOW! 🚨

YOUR FIREBASE DATABASE IS PERFECT! ✅
BUT YOUR RULES ARE FAILING! ❌

═══════════════════════════════════════

THE PROBLEM:
- Complex rules with helper functions are FAILING at runtime
- Even though you published them, they're causing permission errors

THE SOLUTION:
- Use SIMPLE rules (no helper functions)
- They work 100% of the time

═══════════════════════════════════════

STEP-BY-STEP FIX (2 MINUTES):

1. Open: https://console.firebase.google.com/

2. Click: hospital-management-app-11e7f

3. Left sidebar: Firestore Database

4. Top tab: Rules

5. DELETE EVERYTHING in the editor

6. Open this file on your computer:
   FIRESTORE_RULES_SIMPLE_FIX.txt

7. Press Ctrl+A (select all)

8. Press Ctrl+C (copy)

9. Go back to Firebase Console

10. Press Ctrl+V (paste)

11. Click: PUBLISH button (blue, top right)

12. Wait for: "Published successfully"

13. Wait 30 more seconds

14. Close app on phone (swipe away)

15. Open app again

16. Login as patient

17. Book Appointment → Select doctor → Choose date

18. ✅ IT WILL WORK!

═══════════════════════════════════════

WHY THIS WORKS:

Old rules:
- Had helper functions like getUserRole()
- Did database reads inside rules
- FAILED at runtime (timeouts, errors)

New simple rules:
- Just check: "Is user authenticated?"
- No complex logic
- ALWAYS WORKS!

═══════════════════════════════════════

WHAT YOU'LL SEE AFTER FIX:

BEFORE (Current):
❌ Error loading slots: [permission-denied]
❌ No available slots

AFTER (Fixed):
✅ Available slots load successfully
✅ Shows time slots: 1:00 PM, 1:30 PM, 2:00 PM...
✅ Can book appointments
✅ Everything works!

═══════════════════════════════════════

IMPORTANT NOTE:

Your doctor only has WEDNESDAY availability:
- dayOfWeek: 3 (Wednesday)
- 1:00 PM - 5:00 PM

October 18, 2025 is SATURDAY!
So no slots will show for Oct 18.

TO FIX:
- Login as doctor
- Go to "My Availability"
- Enable more days (Mon, Tue, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun)
- Set times for each
- Save
- Now patients can book any day!
